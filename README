The aim of this project is using the Piccolo C2000 Control Stick for controlling the switch states of several DC/DC Switch Mode Converters.

We start from a project example provided in the C2000 Piccolo 1-Day Workshop which can be downloaded from the Texas Instruments web page.

All the project will be developed with Code Composer 5.2

As we can see the project is written in C.

Every project consists of several files. The most important ones for this project are explained below.

	Main.c --> Initializes all the modules of the Control Stick and enters in a permanent loop waiting for interruptions to work.
	
	Gpio.c --> General Purpose Input/Output. Here we assign the pins of the Control Stick to the output of the modules. For example we can assign a pin as ADC so we can read the signal connected to it, or as PWM, so we can use the output of de PWM module in our converter.
	
	EPwm.c --> Enchanced Pulse Width Modulation. It manages the behaviour of the EPwm module, where we can generate PWM. More information is provided in "ePWM_spruge9d.pdf" in the doc folder.
	
	Adc.c --> Analog to Digital Conversion module. Once configured it can be used to measure voltage inputs between 0-3.3v. We must generate a SOC (Start of Conversion) pulse with the Epwm Module. In Adc.c we will assign this pulse to an Adc channel and set other options.
	
	DefaultIsr.c --> Here we handle the code of all the possible interrupts we can generate with the rest of the modules.
