In this example we will set the code necessary for using a 1 phase buck converter controlled by a current hysteresis band. 

We will calculate the current rip in the coil and set 2 bands in the piccolo's comparator. Depending on the load and the current average we want to determine Vout, we will set and upper and a lower band. When the current reaches the upper band, the PWM will turn off and when the current reaches the lower band the PWM will turn on.

We will also need to calculate the current gain through the current sensor and the controller, so we can determine the bands.

We can control the buck converter through the Connector 2 with the following signals.
	V1, V2 --> They will control the PWM of one of the two phases of the buck converter.
	V3, V4 --> They control the second phase. In this example they will be connected to ground as we won't be using it.
	V5, V6, V7 --> They will control the load by connecting several resistors in parallel.
	
We will have 12V input voltage and 5V output voltage.
